My application for Tier 1 (General) was initially rejected because of one missing document even though I put a lot of effort and time in checking all the documentation!!
I was frustrated and I decided to look for a solicitor to look into my case, 
even though I knew that would qualify under Tier 1 (General), but I did not want to risk it.</p>
<p>I started searching online and Mr Kamal's name came-up and to be perfectly honest, I was a bit sceptical in the beginning,
as it sounded too good to be true - Same day premium service! After doing a bit of research, 
I knew that OISC-registered advisors are given block appointments something which is not available for the public.
</p>
<p>Even if you want to get your own appointment through the UKBA you will simply struggle to get a slot. So, my advice is simple - pass on your case to Mr. Kamal - Don't look back as you will be in good hands. He provides a prompt and professional service. He even keeps you informed (via text messages) 
throughout the whole process which is very reassuring. Thank you, Kamal for your Premium service. </p>

This is to testify that, previously, when I have applied for Indefinite Leave to Remain, I was taken for a ride by 
the so called solicitors. On a lucky day whilest browsing through the net, I found Mr Kamal Kandel's name and I called him immediately.</p>
<p>He took my job on the spot and he himself personally came to meet me at my work place (because of my busy schedule). Then there
was no looking back. He took all of my papers, submitted them and without much waiting, the job was done.</p>
<p>
I think, so many single parent like myself, who are busy with a full time job and unable to spare the time for there immigration matters
can completely rely on Mr Kamal Kandel, who is a through and efficient professional and I would recommend him to anyone who 
is in need of Home Office Help.</p>
<p>He is also very ethical and reliable and gets the job done within the minimal of waiting times.</p>

Dear Kamal, Thank you for your professional help in our recent application for UK residency.
We were very pleased with the advice given and the speed with which you completed the process. 
<br />Your office close to Heathrow made easy road access for us as we do not live in London. 
I would recommend you to any other New Zealanders who are about to embark on this process.

I can highly recommend Kamal Kandel’s professional service with regards visa/citizenship application. My case was clearly not straight forward, 
but Kamal easily addressed all the technical issues which allowed for a successful application.  
<br />I was impressed with the way he told me to prepare my application; he then thoroughly checked all my documentation and personally submitted my application. Kamal reassured me during the process and his communication in general, 
but specifically on the day of submission was excellent.
His fee for services rendered is without doubt the best in the market.
<br />Kamal I am indebted to you and will happily recommend you to anyone applying for any visa.

I took Mr. Kandel's services to apply for ILR for my family and would definitely recommend him especially 
if one needs a visa stamped urgently. Once you clear all your doubts either over the phone or email, ensure 
the documents are in order and submit it to him, it is a matter of a week at the most.<br>
He is friendly, accommodative and his office is conveniently located close to Hounslow station. 
You can also send the documents by recorded post as an alternative if you wish. 
I recommend his services as a reliable OISC registered advisor. Thanks Mr. Kandel.</p>

I had a very good experience in the processing my Tier 1 (General) application through Mr. Kamal Kandel. I have been long thinking for applying my Tier 1 visa and when I came to know that I am eligible for it under new rules I thought of getting it done.<br>
I had a chat with various Visa consultants available in market but after a initial chat with most of them I found that either they are not very good at what they are supposed to do or they have an exorbitant consultancy fee ( I mean £ 1000 for just consultation!!). Luckily I came in contact with Kamal who is not only good at his work but his services are a true value for money. <br>
I can bet that you can’t find anyone better at a similar fee. Starting from reviewing the documents, 
guidance for getting any missing documentation, filling of application form (which is quite daunting)
and finally representing your case at home office, Kamal does everything for you with utmost professionalism
 and honesty at a very reasonable price, probably the best for same day applications.<br>

Due to his sincere efforts there were no problems with my application and I got my stamping done in one day. I would definitely recommend his service to all others seeking for their UK visa.
Thank You Kamal for all your help and support in getting my Tier 1 visa done.

Kamal was very helpful and showed excellent knowledge and experience in dealing with my ILR application,
without which I likely would have had to reapply. He has completed many UK visa applications successfully
so knows the system very well and what is required.<br>
 
He was very personable and flexible in dealing with my business, as I 
could often only meet after normal work hours or weekends. I highly recommend his
professional services to anyone in a similar situation.

My case of having ILR (Indefinite Leave to remain) was straight forward but only thing that was required to have it done within a week. I had taken an in person appointment from home office for 
premium service to get it done on same day but I got that appointment after a month.<p>
I got reference of Kamal when I was searching information on internet for some immigration advisor then I got to know about UKVisaExpert.com. Since that was my first interaction with Kamal 
so I also verified on OISC website where he is registered under same given OISC registration number. 
I contacted Kamal through email which he promptly responded.</p>
<p>
I submitted my documents with Kamal on Tuesday for ILR and got my ILR visa done on Wednesday (Next day)  and that was quite quick which solved my objective of getting it done in a week. During processing of my ILR visa, I was kept updated by Kamal on the progress of each stage of my visa processing which is quite convincing about his credibility. 
I will surely recommend Kamal for best immigration services in case of ILR or any other immigration services.</p>
