It was really pleasure to have Kamal to do my Visa work.
He was really helpful from day one when I first contacted him
about the query related to my ILR application. He gave me time
whenever required and help me thru out the process. I strongly recommend him
for all Visa related to issue/queries.He really made my application process easy and get thru.</p>

I found Kamal to be very pleasant and highly proficient in dealings
with UKBA. He is up to date with the requirements for visa
applications and checks all relevant documents thoroughly.
I applied for an ILR and Kamal attended the Croydon office on the day I
requested him to go.<br>
He kept me dully informed about the process and
went an extra mile to return the documents out of hours. I would
certainly recommend him to people who need a reliable, speedy and
honest representation.

Hey Kamal,<br>

You can write what ever you would like to say ...... but ...... it must have the folowing:<br>
Kamal is awesome, he is simply the best. I was a terribly unorganized client and I had my visa the same day.
Thank you very very much.

I had a very good 
experience in applying for indefinite leave to remain  through Kamal.
He is a professional and reliable advisor. My application was successful 
just within a week. 
There were several points
that were not clear to me about the application and Kamal gave me good advice.
</p>

<p>He was very quick in replying to my enquiries and sent me updates on the day of the application,

which was very reassuring. 
Kamal provides an excellent service at a very reasonable cost and 
I can recommend him to 
anyone who is looking for a reliable OISC registered advisor at a reasonable price.</p>
