<hr>
<p >
I am very glad to write my review on Kamal and UKVISAEXPERT, based on my recent application for Indefinite Leave to Remain, ILR. To begin with I was bit nervous initially before making my application. 
I looked around few websites and people offering such services and based on the feedback about Kamal, I enquired over phone with him. He promptly answered my queries on my first chat. 
After I decided to go with him, for my and my family ILR, I arranged a suitable time in a weekend to discuss and submit all the necessary documents to him.
</p>
<p>
He send after my initial chat, all the necessary/additional and optional documents list to me, which helped me to get all the documents available before meeting him. I met him at his office and he verified all the documents and started with my application. On the application date we went and met Kamal at PEO Croydon on time. He took us in and to be honest, it was like a visitor visiting the offices for me such relaxing and no tension. We went relaxed as Kamal take care of the other works. He took us to the application registration followed by Biometrics registration. After this we spent half an hour in the waiting area, had coffee and relaxed with the kids. Kamal assured me that we can leave if necessary as he was representing  us he would be there anyway. We left Croydon Home Office after a total 45 minutes but Kamal updated me the status of application over SMS message in the due course. In the evening he called and confirmed that our application is approved and he received all the original documents. A few days later he received our BRP cards and I went on the week end and collected all my documents. Very peaceful process.  
He have organised in such a good shape that everything was clear and straight forward.It's really a good service from Kamal. 
</p>
<p>
I mentioned this to my friend who is planning to apply for his family ILR is now interested to go through Kamal. My personal advice, if you are thinking of applying 
for ILR for you or family, give a call to him and am sure you can rest peace assured on you application process.

I would like to thank UK Visa Expert for their help on my FLR application. We were in contact everyday whilst Kamal and his staff would advise if I have the correct documents etc.
I will definatly be using Kamal again as all the pressure was certainly taken away as Kamal had everything in order.

I had applied for my Tier 1 extension and ILR through Kamal and was extremely impressed with his professionalism and keen eye to detail. 
He kept us informed about the required documents well in advance. 
</p>

<p>
He is well aware of all visa related regulations and up to date with any changes. 
I would strongly recommend Kamal and ukvisaexpert.com for a stress free and smooth visa application.
