<hr>
<p>
I am very glad to write my review on Kamal and UKVISAEXPERT, based on my recent application for Indefinite Leave to Remain, ILR. To begin with I was bit nervous initially before making my application. 
I looked around few websites and people offering such services and based on the feedback about Kamal, I enquired over phone with him. He promptly answered my queries on my first chat. 
After I decided to go with him, for my and my family ILR, I arranged a suitable time in a weekend to discuss and submit all the necessary documents to him.
</p>
<p>
He send after my initial chat, all the necessary/additional and optional documents list to me, which helped me to get all the documents available before meeting him. I met him at his office and he verified all the documents and started with my application. On the application date we went and met Kamal at PEO Croydon on time. He took us in and to be honest, it was like a visitor visiting the offices for me such relaxing and no tension. We went relaxed as Kamal take care of the other works. He took us to the application registration followed by Biometrics registration. After this we spent half an hour in the waiting area, had coffee and relaxed with the kids. Kamal assured me that we can leave if necessary as he was representing  us he would be there anyway. We left Croydon Home Office after a total 45 minutes but Kamal updated me the status of application over SMS message in the due course. In the evening he called and confirmed that our application is approved and he received all the original documents. A few days later he received our BRP cards and I went on the week end and collected all my documents. Very peaceful process.  
He have organised in such a good shape that everything was clear and straight forward.It's really a good service from Kamal. 
</p>
<p>
I mentioned this to my friend who is planning to apply for his family ILR is now interested to go through Kamal. My personal advice, if you are thinking of applying 
for ILR for you or family, give a call to him and am sure you can rest peace assured on you application process.

Service provided by Mr. Kamal & staff of UK Visa Expert was excellent & friendly, nevertheless their professionalism has been outstanding, price is competitive and their prompt response. 
</p>

<p>
I processed my Tier-1 visa with other firms but decision was not taken on same day due to lack of supporting documents but Mr.Kamal 
presented my application very well with supporting documents which case worker expects and decision was taken quickly.
I will definitely recommend UK Visa Expert firm to anyone I come across.

I have used Mr Kamal and his associate's service in order to apply for the indefinite leave to remain in the UK and I have been extremely satisfied and impressed with the service they have provided. The fee charged was nominal when compared to the other solicitors providing the same service (which is nearly double) and the quality of service they provide is very high.</p>
<p>All the documentation specifications were clearly specified in advance to me and
 someone from their office was always available to speak over the phone and via email. I got the ILR within a few hours on the same day. Overall, I would strongly recommend ukvisaexpert.com's service for a tension and hassle free IRL application.</p>

I found Kamal to be very pleasant and highly proficient in dealings
with UKBA. He is up to date with the requirements for visa
applications and checks all relevant documents thoroughly.
I applied for an ILR and Kamal attended the Croydon office on the day I
requested him to go.<br>
He kept me dully informed about the process and
went an extra mile to return the documents out of hours. I would
certainly recommend him to people who need a reliable, speedy and
honest representation.

I had a very good 
experience in applying for indefinite leave to remain  through Kamal.
He is a professional and reliable advisor. My application was successful 
just within a week. 
There were several points
that were not clear to me about the application and Kamal gave me good advice.
</p>

<p>He was very quick in replying to my enquiries and sent me updates on the day of the application,

which was very reassuring. 
Kamal provides an excellent service at a very reasonable cost and 
I can recommend him to 
anyone who is looking for a reliable OISC registered advisor at a reasonable price.</p>

My application for Tier 1 (General) was initially rejected because of one missing document even though I put a lot of effort and time in checking all the documentation!!
I was frustrated and I decided to look for a solicitor to look into my case, 
even though I knew that would qualify under Tier 1 (General), but I did not want to risk it.</p>
<p>I started searching online and Mr Kamal's name came-up and to be perfectly honest, I was a bit sceptical in the beginning,
as it sounded too good to be true - Same day premium service! After doing a bit of research, 
I knew that OISC-registered advisors are given block appointments something which is not available for the public.
</p>
<p>Even if you want to get your own appointment through the UKBA you will simply struggle to get a slot. So, my advice is simple - pass on your case to Mr. Kamal - Don't look back as you will be in good hands. He provides a prompt and professional service. He even keeps you informed (via text messages) 
throughout the whole process which is very reassuring. Thank you, Kamal for your Premium service. </p>

This is to testify that, previously, when I have applied for Indefinite Leave to Remain, I was taken for a ride by 
the so called solicitors. On a lucky day whilest browsing through the net, I found Mr Kamal Kandel's name and I called him immediately.</p>
<p>He took my job on the spot and he himself personally came to meet me at my work place (because of my busy schedule). Then there
was no looking back. He took all of my papers, submitted them and without much waiting, the job was done.</p>
<p>
I think, so many single parent like myself, who are busy with a full time job and unable to spare the time for there immigration matters
can completely rely on Mr Kamal Kandel, who is a through and efficient professional and I would recommend him to anyone who 
is in need of Home Office Help.</p>
<p>He is also very ethical and reliable and gets the job done within the minimal of waiting times.</p>

His fee for services rendered is without doubt the best in the market.
