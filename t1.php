I have used Mr Kamal and his associate's service in order to apply for the indefinite leave to remain in the UK and I have been extremely satisfied and impressed with the service they have provided. The fee charged was nominal when compared to the other solicitors providing the same service (which is nearly double) and the quality of service they provide is very high.</p>
<p>All the documentation specifications were clearly specified in advance to me and
 someone from their office was always available to speak over the phone and via email. I got the ILR within a few hours on the same day. Overall, I would strongly recommend ukvisaexpert.com's service for a tension and hassle free IRL application.</p>
